# Video-Processing-and-Image-Stitching-Corner-Detection-and-Panoramic-Reconstruction
**Note:** This project was a requirement for the course ENPM 673- Perception for Autonomous Robots at University of Maryland, College Park

## Project Description
The project includes two tasks: 
* Detecting the four corners and edges of a piece of paper in a video using edge detection, Hough Transform, and corner detection while filtering out blurry frames
* Stitching multiple overlapping images into a panoramic image using feature matching, RANSAC, and homography computation.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.11.11
* Google Colab

## Libraries used
* OpenCv
* Numpy
  
## Instructions
* Clone the repository or download the zip file. Upload the 'kinikara_project1.ipynb' file to Google Drive along with the 4 '.jpg' and 'project2_v2.mp4' files. Click on the '.ipynb' file, which would open it in Google Colab. In code snippet 2, change 'path_to_folder' to your path.
* Run the code snippets one after the other. The explanation of the concept and the code is in the python notebook
